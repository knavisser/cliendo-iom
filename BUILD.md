# Building Portable Executable

This guide explains how to build a portable executable that includes the bundled Chromium browser.

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js (version 18 or higher)
2. npm or yarn package manager

## Build Process

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- `puppeteer` (includes bundled Chromium)
- `pkg` (for creating executables)
- Other required dependencies

### 2. Build the Executable

For Windows only:
```bash
npm run build
```

For multiple platforms:
```bash
npm run build-all
```

This creates executables in the `dist/` folder for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### 3. Prepare for Distribution

After building, you need to include:
- The generated `.exe` file
- The `.env` file (with your OpenAI API key)

## Key Changes Made

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Bundled Chromium**: Switched from `puppeteer-core` to `puppeteer` which includes a bundled Chromium browser
2. **Shared Browser Instance**: Browser is launched once and shared between modules
3. **Portable Configuration**: No longer depends on system Chrome installation
4. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and fallback mechanisms

### File Changes

- `package.json`: Updated dependencies and build configuration
- `boot-all.js`: Completely rewritten to use Puppeteer's bundled Chromium
- `inject-code.js`: Updated to use shared browser instance
- `.gitignore`: Added Chromium download exclusions

### Benefits

1. **Portable**: Works on any Windows machine without Chrome installed
2. **Consistent**: Same browser version across all deployments
3. **Reliable**: No path detection issues or version conflicts
4. **Self-contained**: Everything needed is bundled in the executable

## Distribution

The final executable will be larger (~150-200MB) because it includes:
- Node.js runtime
- Chromium browser
- Your application code
- Dependencies

But it will be completely portable and not require any installation on target machines.

## Troubleshooting

### Large File Size
- This is expected due to bundled Chromium (~100MB)
- Consider using compression tools for distribution

### Performance
- First launch may be slower as Chromium initializes
- Subsequent operations should be normal speed

### Antivirus Warnings
- Some antivirus software may flag the executable
- This is common with packaged Node.js applications
- Consider code signing for production distribution

## Environment Variables

Make sure to include a `.env` file with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or set the environment variable on the target system.
