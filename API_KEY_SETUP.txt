# ðŸ”‘ API Key Setup Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Set up your OpenAI API key

This application requires an OpenAI API key to function. For security reasons, the API key is NOT included in the executable.

### Option 1: Environment File (Recommended)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the same directory as the executable
2. Edit `.env` and replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key
3. Save the file

### Option 2: System Environment Variable (ASK TONY FIRST)
Set a system environment variable:
- Windows: `set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- macOS/Linux: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Security Notes
- Never share your API key
- Keep your `.env` file secure
- Consider using API key restrictions in your OpenAI account

### Troubleshooting
If you see "OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing", check:
1. The `.env` file exists in the same directory as the executable
2. The `.env` file contains `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key`
3. There are no extra spaces or quotes around the key
